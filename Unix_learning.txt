1.  Use sort and uniq command to sort a file and print unique values.
sort record.txt | uniq

2. How to Redirect stderr to stdout in Bash
In Bash and other Linux shells, when a program is executed, it uses three standard I/O streams. Each stream is represented by a numeric file descriptor:

0 - stdin, the standard input stream.
1 - stdout, the standard output stream.
2 - stderr, the standard error stream.
A file descriptor is just a number representing an open file.

When we use |   , then only stdout contents will be copied to the file , when you use |& then both stdout and stderr will be copied to the files.

3. To run the command in background use &

4. sed command    (Stream Editor)
